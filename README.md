Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing sales data from different regions, tiers, and divisions for the years 2015 and 2016. The primary goal is to uncover trends, compare sales performance, and identify any declines in sales or units sold. The analysis employs various data visualization techniques using Python libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.
Key Tasks and Visualizations:
Comparing Sales by Region (2015 vs. 2016):
Created a bar chart to compare total sales for each region between 2015 and 2016.
Pie Charts for Regional Sales (2016):
Generated pie charts to visualize the proportion of sales in each region for the year 2016.
Sales Comparison by Region and Tiers (2015 vs. 2016):
Utilized bar charts to compare sales across different regions and tiers for both years.
Sales Decline in the East Region (2016 vs. 2015):
Identified which states in the East region experienced a decline in sales in 2016 compared to 2015 using bar charts.
High Tier Division Units Sold Decline (2016 vs. 2015):
Analyzed divisions within the High tier to find those with a decline in units sold in 2016 compared to 2015.
Quarter-wise Sales Comparison (2015 vs. 2016):
Created a new column for quarters and compared sales for each quarter between 2015 and 2016 using bar plots.
Quarter-wise Sales Composition (2015):
Generated pie charts to show the composition of sales across different tiers for each quarter in 2015.
